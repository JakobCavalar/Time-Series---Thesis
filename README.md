# Time-Series---Thesis


This Repository is storing the Code I have used to create simulations plots and other stuff for my master´s thesis: Ein Vergleich der Verfahren X-13-ARIMA-SEATS und BV4.1 zur Analyse von Zeitreihen.

The Code was just copied and pasted into this repository, so dont expect everything to run without making minor adjustments. Especially to the simulations itself since it has been done on a univerity server and therefore needed to be adapted for this. Therefore I have included a file that I did not use but does the same simulation on your local device.
